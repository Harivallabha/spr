# Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Self-Predictive Representations

*Max Schwarzer\*, Ankesh Anand\*, Rishab Goel, R Devon Hjelm, Aaron Courville, Philip Bachman*

This repo provides code for implementing the [SPR paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05929)

* [ðŸ“¦ Install ](#install) -- Install relevant dependencies and the project
* [ðŸ”§ Usage ](#usage) -- Commands to run different experiments from the paper

## Install 
To install the requirements, follow these steps:
```bash
# PyTorch
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
export LANG=C.UTF-8

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Login to W&B
wandb login {wandb_key}

# Finally, install the project
pip install --user -e git+git://github.com/ankeshanand/abstract-world-models
```

## Usage:
The default branch for the latest and stable changes is `release`. 

* Sample run script with augmentation
```bash
python -m scripts.run_pizero --grayscale --game ms_pacman --num-envs 64 --num-trainers 3 --no-gpu-0-train 
```

## What does each file do?
